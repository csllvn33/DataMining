Mining Consumer Complaints

Cary Sullivan and Ryan Wills

Description: We looked at issues submitted by consumers to several major credit card companies over several years. We hope to find patterns based on the company used, credit card issue, and area that will help consumers and companies alike understand the types of credit card crimes that are common. We believe that by finding trends, patterns, and/or correlations between these certain attributes, it may help credit card companies become more secure, more reliable, and be able to offer the consumer a safer, better, and more secure experience while using their cards. If this is achieved, the overall confidence of the consumer in the credit card company will increase, benefiting both parties.

Questions sought to answer: How can we flag certain problem areas by correlating the credit card company used by the customer, what issue they were having, and where they experienced this problem?
